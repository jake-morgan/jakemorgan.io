As I have gotten older the idea of a New Year resolution has been met with more and more cynicism, as people berate the idea of a having an arbitrary date in which to suddenly attempt to change something in your life. If you are living an unhealthy life why wait until the New Year to join the gym? If you are so concerned with the welfare of animals, then why wait until the New Year to take up veganism? The high failure rate is another often cited argument against the idea of New Year resolutions, a study from Bristol University showed that 88% of those who set New Year resolutions failed[^1]. This can be down to all sorts of factors including setting too many resolutions, January not exactly being the best month in terms of motivating individuals, and even just forgetting that you ever set a resolution for yourself.

But there is good reason for why New Year's resolutions are still a thing people talk about every year. Having a hard reset is something that cannot be underestimated. The opportunity to undertake a change in your life overnight can be freeing and can alleviate any guilt you may have had regarding the resolution in the past. It also gives individuals the chance to undertake a change with others, the chance to go through the often accompanying suffering and withdrawal that comes with many New Year's resolutions not alone, but with friends and family alike.

For myself the most valuable part of setting a New Year's resolution is reflection. It gives me a chance to look at where I am now, and where I want to end up in a month or in a year. What do I have to do or change to be the person I want to be? Individuals too infrequently take the time to stop and reflect on what they are doing and think about what they could change in their lives.

The podcast [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) talks about yearly themes as an alternative to New Year's resolutions, framing a year with a theme allows people to make decisions throughout the year taking into account the theme they set themselves at the start. One of the hosts of the show Grey decides that 2016 is going to be *The Year of Less*, a year in which he will aim to focus on the important things in his life and focus on them over starting new projects where he feels is spreading himself too thinly which will only end up causing problems for him in the future. The idea of a yearly theme appeals to me, you're not really setting yourself something that you can fail at, you are more giving yourself a way to measure the decisions and actions that you make and how they affect where you want to be.

2018 was a mad year: writing my dissertation, graduating from university, moving into a new flat, and landing a job in what I can only describe as the dream workplace along with meeting a whole load of new people, 2018 has been non-stop from start to finish. So looking forward into 2019 what are my New Year's resolutions? If you are reading this then I have achieved at least one, to have created a website. I don't particularly expect anyone to read or enjoy what I write, it's more a place for me to put down my thoughts almost like a diary, and if just one person finds value in a post then that is good enough for me.

As for a yearly theme, *The Year of Opportunity* has a nice ring to it. The company I work for offer some amazing opportunities from travelling to conferences and meetups, to learning new technologies. I need to get better at saying yes to these opportunities and need to be going out looking for new things to learn and discover, as these opportunities may not come around again in my career.
