Hi I'm Jake :wave: 

I'm a computer science graduate living in Cardiff after fledging the nest in Pembrokeshire. Currently working as an engineer for [DevOpsGroup](https://www.devopsgroup.com/ "devopsgroup.com") I work with enterprise and scale-up businesses to help modernise their IT through cloud and DevOps technologies, all whilst working in an Agile way. I have experience working with Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, AWS, Azure and many other related technologies.

I'm passionate about improving the software delivery experience and engineering highly available platforms in the cloud whilst never compromising on quality. My other interests includes sports such as kayaking and bouldering, cooking, and playing board games.
